    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or
        programming languages by representing the structure of a document—such
        as the HTML representing a web page—in memory. Usually that means
        JavaScript, although modelling HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects
        is not part of the JavaScript language, as such.</p>
